# Rainbow-Poem
This is a repo for my poem.

**Life is like a one way road ,**


**we are like vehicle running on it.**

**Lots of twist and turns are there,**


**But never get a chance to take a "U" Turn.**

**Life is like a rainbow having different colors, 

**showing sour and sweet moments ,**

**Be there to experience every flavours,**

**so Enjoy your Life with a fullest My DEAR!! **
